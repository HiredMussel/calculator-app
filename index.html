                        <p> 
                            For those who don't want to pay the cost of the course up front, there is the 
                            possibility of an interest-free loan from EdAid to cover some or all of the cost 
                            of the course.<br>
                            <br>
                            You may borrow any amount up to the total cost of the course (£8,000). EdAid charge
                            a 5% administrative fee which will be added to the total amount you repay.<br>
                            <br>
                            In addition, an extra fee is charged if you borrow more than a certain amount. If you
                            intend to borrow more than 80% of the course's cost (£6,400), then the total cost of
                            the course is increased to £8,500.<br>
                            <br>
                            If you borrow over 90% of the cost of the course (£7,200), then the total cost of the 
                            course is £9,000.<br>
                            <br>
                            Repayments are made as a percentage of annual salary. At least 10% of your monthly salary
                            must go towards repaying the cost of the course, starting from three months after your
                            graduation. There is no minimum income threshold before this applies.<br>
                            <br>
                            Payments are made on the 1st of each month, and there is no maximum number of months for
                            a student to pay back the cost of the course.
